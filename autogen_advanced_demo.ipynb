    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates an advanced AutoGen concept: **Creating specialized agents with distinct roles that can dynamically collaborate and utilize external tools**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Important: Google Colab Setup Required\n",
    "This notebook is optimized for Google Colab. It includes:\n",
    "- Automatic package installation\n",
    "- Secure API key handling via Google Colab secrets\n",
    "- Colab-specific configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Discussion Points:\n",
    "1. **Agent Specialization**: How different agents can have unique expertise\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Collaboration**: Agents deciding when to collaborate vs. work independently\n",
    "3. **Tool Integration**: Agents using external tools and sharing results\n",
    "4. **Conversation Flow Control**: Managing complex multi-agent interactions\n",

    "1. **Package Installation Issues**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # If packages fail to install, try:\n",
    "   !pip install --upgrade pip\n",
    "   !pip install pyautogen --force-reinstall\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "   print(f\"API Key loaded: {'Yes' if OPENAI_API_KEY else 'No'}\")\n",
    "   print(f\"Key starts with: {OPENAI_API_KEY[:8] if OPENAI_API_KEY else 'None'}...\")\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Memory Issues**:\n",
    "   - Use `Runtime > Factory reset runtime` if you encounter memory issues\n",
    "   - Consider using shorter conversations or fewer agents for complex tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Performance Tips:\n",
    "- Run cells in order to ensure proper setup\n",
    "- Use `Runtime > Run all` to execute the entire notebook\n",
